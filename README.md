* You may realize nothing happens after click on a white region. Some regions don't have data associated with them and it was there for pratice of fool design proof in which doesn't allow user to do illegal actions.
* This was Some regions are not playable because it has enough regions to demonstrate the idea behind this game. Those regions have white colors.
